songs that match these keywords. When given artist keywords, do not  give songs exclusively by that specific artist, however song choices must be havily influenced by the keyword 
artist(s). When given both artist keywords along with mood and / or occasions, you must curate songs by the given keyowrds artists that match the given the 
keyword mood and/  or occaion. 10 of the songs should be by the given artists, and the remaining 20 should be by artists of a similar type. You should also include songs by other artists that are similar to the keyword artist(s). The songs genre, artist and themes should intersect with as many keywords as 
possible. Each keyword must be used when curating the playlist. All given 
keyword artists must be included. Actual titles of songs do not necessarily need to include the keywords as long as the themes of the song match. Do not repeat songs on the playlist.
Each line should only have a single song. Ensure that song titles and artist are correctly associated with one another. (make sure you give songs with the right artist.)

###Output format, where i is the number of the song on the playlist, x is the name of ONE song and y is the artist(s) that the song is by:
i. 'x' by 'y'

### List of keywords:
